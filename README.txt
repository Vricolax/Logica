Input 2:
Calculation using the NOT gate - One input required

Input 3:
Presentation of compile error: The gate inserted does not exist.

Input 4:
Presentation of multiline support. In this case many lines of code are executed.

Input 5:

How to execute the runnable jar (logica.jar) with the inputs:

*In order to properly execute the runnable jar (logica.jar), 
 the desired txt file from the "examples" folder must be located at the same folder as the runnable jar.
 
Then, the execution of the runnable goes as follows:

1) Run the cmd (Command Prompt) in Windows.

2) Go to the location of logica.jar using the command "cd" (without the quotes)

3) To execute it, type: "java -jar logica.jar file.txt" (Without the quotes). 
   *Note that "file.txt" must be replaced by the desired input file. For example: input3.txt
